# SBCL Processus management wrapper
Very thin wrapping around some of the utilities of SBCL for starting, stopping
and piping strings to processes.
Wrote mainly to avoid the lengthy syntax of some of the functions provided by
SBCL. You're probably better off using them as they are without this wrapper.
I publish this as it gives some examples of how to run and communicate with
external programs with SBCL.
